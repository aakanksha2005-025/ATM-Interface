This Java project is a simple implementation of an ATM Interface that simulates basic banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money. The program is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and consists of two main classes: one for the BankAccount and another for the ATM machine. The BankAccount class stores the current balance and provides methods to perform deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks. The ATM class handles the user interface through a console-based menu system, allowing users to select operations interactively. Proper input validation is implemented to ensure actions like withdrawal are only performed when the account has sufficient balance, and deposits must be of valid amounts. The program displays clear messages to guide the user through each transaction. The initial balance is set by default, and users can perform multiple operations in a single session. This project demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts such as classes, methods, conditionals, and user input handling using the Scanner class.
